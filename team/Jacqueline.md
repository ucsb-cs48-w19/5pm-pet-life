I'm Jacqueline, I go by Jackie, Jac, Jacqueline, whatever's easier  for you. I am a third year and I have barely done anything outside of class assignments, so this is a learning experience. 


Team norms: Everyone keeps in contact and sets deadlines and makes sure to check in with each other in case something happens.
