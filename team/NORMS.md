I think having a meeting time outside of class to work is a good idea. Consistent updates between team members is important (through slack or/and messenger), since other team members’ work might rely upon another aspect being finished first.

Be respectful to each other and help each other out. Everyone is coming with different skill levels and experiences, so something super obvious to one member may be totally new to another.

Weekly updates on any progress made. 

I think it’s really important to really get everyone contribute to this project, so that everyone can learn from it.

It would be good if we could organize tasks so that no one feels like they have nothing to do/don’t know what they’re doing. A way to do this is through assigning issues through Github’s kanban board.

I think setting soft deadlines for certain parts of the project would be helpful for the progression of the project.
