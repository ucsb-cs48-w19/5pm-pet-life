TO BE UPDATED AS PROGRESS CONTINUES
 
We are aware that after a collision the dog sometimes falls over and cannot get up and sort of uselessly spins around. This is a result of using 3d physics on 2d assets in a 3d environment and we are looking into how to better integrate 2d into 3d (maybe with a constantly updating script) or finding a 3d model.

Animations plays on a slight delay. 

All physics goes out the window once the dog leaves the house. Take the stairs at your own risk.

Camera is not very smooth, sometimes gets blocked by walls of the house. Maybe update SmoothFollow.cs so that it turns whenever it hits a wall.
